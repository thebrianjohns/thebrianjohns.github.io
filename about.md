My name is Brian Johns. I have spent most of my life involved in sport.  I found success as a result of my willingness to learn new skills, apply an analytical mindset and persevere through adversity.  As a swimmer, these skills allowed me to excel in the water on my way to becoming a 3-time Olympian and World Record Holder.  Now, as a Data Scientist, I am using these same traits to help organizations and businesses dive into their data and accomplish their goals.

I earned my Data Science diploma from BrainStation in 2022.  There, I had to balance my time between handing in weekly deliverables, completing a months-long Capstone project and taking part in a multidisciplinary Industry project hosted by Shopify.  I was able to maintain excellent grades (**94% average**), help our team place runner-up in our Industry Project (out of 32 teams) and was selected to become a Teacher's Assistant based off my performance and ability to communicate.

With this experience, I am now proficient in the following skills to find Data Science solutions:
- Statistical Analysis using **Python** and **R** programming languages
- Data Processing through **SQL** (MySQL)
- Machine Learning using **Scikit-Learn**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**
- Data Visualizations with **Tableau**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Plotly Express**
- Leveraging **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to find Big Data solutions with tools such as **Hadoop**, **Spark**, **Hive** and **SageMaker**
