In British Columbia, car insurance is provided by a single crown corporation: Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC). As a result of being a crown corporation, they are beholden to open data policies within the province similar to a government agency. As such, a significant amount of data about the accidents that occur in the province is made available and can be found [HERE](https://www.icbc.com/about-icbc/newsroom/Pages/Statistics.aspx)

Much of the data can be broken down regionally in BC, or by municipality. Being a Vancouver resident, I am aware that there are a number of unique neighborhoods and communities, 22 in all, within Vancouver. Given the number of unique neighborhoods in Vancouver, I wanted to ask: **are there any trends or insights that could be made about ICBC reported accidents at the neighborhood level in Vancouver?**

This project is broken down into 3 parts:
1. Wrangling and cleaning ICBC data to include Vancouver neighborhood information.
2. Exploratory data analysis using MySQL
3. Creating visualizations and dashboards using Tableau.

In preparation for analysis, I had to gather acquire the geo-location data for each neighborhood from the [City of Vancouver](https://opendata.vancouver.ca/explore/dataset/local-area-boundary/export/?disjunctive.name) and use the location data in the ICBC data to accurately label each accident with the neighborhood they occurred in.  I used the **Shapely** library in order to make the shape of the neighborhood and determine whether an accident occurred within the shape.

Once I completed the data wrangling, I had 213,085 accidents recorded in 23 neighborhoods, adding Stanley Park to the 22 existing neighborhoods in Vancouver.  You can see a map of the Vancouver accident data below:

Part 2 of this project will explore the data using MySQL and identify some trends in the locations, times and descriptions of the data.
