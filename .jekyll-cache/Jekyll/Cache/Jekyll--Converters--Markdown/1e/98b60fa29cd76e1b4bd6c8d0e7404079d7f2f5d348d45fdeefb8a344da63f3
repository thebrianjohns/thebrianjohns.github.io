I"¯<p>My name is Brian Johns. I have spent most of my life involved in sport.  I found success as a result of my willingness to learn new skills, apply an analytical mindset and persevere through adversity.  As a swimmer, these skills allowed me to excel in the water on my way to becoming a 3-time Olympian and World Record Holder.  Now, as a Data Scientist, I am using these same traits to help organizations and businesses dive into their data and accomplish their goals.</p>

<p>I earned my Data Science diploma from BrainStation in 2022.  There, I had to balance my time between handing in weekly deliverables, completing a months-long Capstone project and taking part in a multidisciplinary Industry project hosted by Shopify.  I was able to maintain excellent grades (<strong>94% average</strong>), help our team place runner-up in our Industry Project (out of 32 teams) and was selected to become a Teacherâ€™s Assistant based off my performance and ability to communicate.</p>

<p>With this experience, I am now proficient in the following skills to find Data Science solutions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Statistical Analysis using <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> programming languages</li>
  <li>Data Processing through <strong>SQL</strong> (MySQL)</li>
  <li>Machine Learning using <strong>Scikit-Learn</strong>, <strong>Keras</strong>, <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>PyTorch</strong></li>
  <li>Data Visualizations with <strong>Tableau</strong>, <strong>Matplotlib</strong>, <strong>Seaborn</strong> and <strong>Plotly Express</strong></li>
  <li>Leveraging <strong>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</strong> to find Big Data solutions with tools such as <strong>Hadoop</strong>, <strong>Spark</strong>, <strong>Hive</strong> and <strong>SageMaker</strong></li>
</ul>
